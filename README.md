# Change Challenge Goal

Create a Console app that takes in an amount owed and an amount paid.
Have the app calculate how much change a person is due. Just worry
about change under a dollar.

# Bonus
Handle varying change requests ($5 bill and less, $50 and less, etc.) and return
the amounts for each. Do not use the console commands in your calculations.
Return the values to Main and print them there. 

Do not hard-code anything outside of Main. Handle exact change and under-payment.
