# Change Challenge Goal

Weekly C# challenges are just that - challenges you get every week to complete some task in C#. 
They push you to be better in an area and they help refresh your skills in areas you might not be using right now. 
Every week a new challenge is added to this course. You do have access to past challenges as well, 
including the ability to watch the challenge and the solution offline.
